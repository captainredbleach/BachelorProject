%     name=Software Defined Radio,
%     description= {A software defined radio is based on an antenna, a receiver front end and the mixer software run on a processor. The main difference between typical (hardware) radios and Software defined radios is that the signal processing is performed in software instead of on hardware, which requires varying amounts of computing power depending on the sampling rate, as the system is digital instead of analogue. Some of the benefits in space applications include the ability to re-tune or re-purpose the radio through software.}
